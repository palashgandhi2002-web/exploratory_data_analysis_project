# Exploratory Data Analysis Project

This repository showcases a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project developed by Palash Gandhi, demonstrating key data analytics skills including data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualization using Python tools like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. [github](https://github.com/palashgandhi2002-web/exploratory_data_analysis_project)

## Project Overview

The project follows the full EDA lifecycle: loading data, handling missing values and outliers, univariate/bivariate analysis, correlation studies, and insightful visualizations to uncover patterns and trends. [github](https://github.com/FuadAnalyst/EDA-Exploratory-Data-Analysis)
It highlights practical applications of data exploration techniques suitable for business intelligence and decision-making. [github](https://github.com/topics/data-analytics-project)
Ideal for portfolios, this work aligns with standard EDA practices seen in industry projects. [github](https://github.com/VenkyAdi/EDA---Projects)

## Key Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Removal of duplicates, null handling, and outlier detection via IQR and boxplots. [github](https://github.com/FuadAnalyst/EDA-Exploratory-Data-Analysis)
- **Statistical Analysis**: Measures of central tendency, dispersion, and correlation matrices.
- **Visualizations**: Histograms, scatter plots, heatmaps, and distribution plots for multi-dimensional insights. [github](https://github.com/Sukanyasingh3/Exploratory-data-analysis)
- **Tools Used**: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, possibly Scikit-learn).[user-information]

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/palashgandhi2002-web/exploratory_data_analysis_project.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Open and run the main notebook (e.g., `EDA_Project.ipynb`):
   ```
   jupyter notebook EDA_Project.ipynb
   ```

## Usage

Run the Jupyter notebook sequentially to replicate the analysis. Customize the dataset path in the loading section for your data. [github](https://github.com/Sukanyasingh3/Exploratory-data-analysis)
Example: Insights might include top trends, feature relationships, and recommendations for further modeling.
